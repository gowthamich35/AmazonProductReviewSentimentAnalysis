# AmazonProductReviewSentimentAnalysis
**Overview**
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiments expressed in the text.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project consists of Amazon product reviews collected from various categories. Each review is labeled with its corresponding sentiment (positive, negative).

**Tools and Technologies Used**
Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Library for numerical computing.
Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning algorithms and tools.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Library for natural language processing.

**Methodology**
Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing noise, such as HTML tags, punctuation, and special characters. Tokenize the text and perform stemming or lemmatization.

Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.

Model Development: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression for sentiment classification.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision. Perform cross-validation to ensure the generalization of the model.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model to classify sentiments of new Amazon product reviews.
